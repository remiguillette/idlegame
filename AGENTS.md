3D Farm Scene with React Three Fiber
This project is a 3D interactive scene built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. It demonstrates how to load, display, and interact with .glb 3D models within a web application, showcasing a simple farm scene with a barn.

Features
3D Model Loading: Dynamically loads .glb models into the scene.

Interactive Camera: Orbit controls allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate around the scene.

Basic Scene Setup: Includes essential elements like lighting (ambient, directional) and environment setup.

Component-Based Architecture: The scene is broken down into reusable React components for better organization and scalability.
